			<h2>  Chapter 8 - OpenMP Directives and Other Function Calls </h2></font>
			<center><p>
<h3>Synchronization Constructs</h3>
<p>Consider a simple example where two threads are both trying to update variable x at the same time: 
 <center><img  src="19.png"/>
<p><b>One possible execution sequence: </b>
<p>Thread 1 initializes x to 0 and calls update(x) 
<p>Thread 1 adds 1 to x. 
<p>x now equals 1 
<p>Thread 2 initializes x to 0 and calls update(x) 
<p>x now equals 0 
<p>Thread 1 prints x, which is equal to 0 instead of 1 
<p>Thread 2 adds 1 to x. 
<p>x now equals 1. 
<p>Thread 2 prints x as 1. 

<p><b>To avoid a situation like this, the updating of x must be synchronized between the two threads to ensure that the correct result is produced. </b>
<p>OpenMP provides a variety of Synchronization Constructs that control how the execution of each thread proceeds relative to other team threads.
<p>
<p><h3>The MASTER directive</h3>
<p>This specifies a region that is to be executed only by the master thread of the team. All other threads on the team skip this section of code.
<p>There is no implied barrier associated with this directive. This is the format for the MASTER directive in C/C++:
<p>
<p><p>#pragma omp master  newline
<p>
<p>   structured_block
<p>
<p><h3>The CRITICAL directive</h3>
<p>This specifies a region of code that must be executed by only one thread at a time. If a thread is currently executing inside a CRITICAL region and another thread reaches that CRITICAL region and attempts to execute it, it will block until the first thread exits that CRITICAL region.
<p>This is the format for the CRITICAL directive in C/C++:
<p><p>#pragma omp critical [ name ]  newline
<p>
<p>   structured_block
<p>
<p><h3>The BARRIER directive</h3>
<p>This synchronizes all threads in the team. 
<p>When a BARRIER directive is reached, a thread will wait at that point until all other threads have reached that barrier. All threads then resume executing in parallel the code that follows the barrier.
<p>This is the format for the BARRIER directive in C/C++:
<p><p>#pragma omp barrier  newline
<p>
<p><h3>The ORDERED directive</h3>
<p>This specifies that iterations of the enclosed loop will be executed in the same order as if they were executed on a serial processor. 
<p>Threads will need to wait before executing their chunk of iterations if previous iterations haven't completed yet. 
<p>Used within a DO / for loop with an ORDERED clause 
<p>The ORDERED directive provides a way to "fine tune" where ordering is to be applied within a loop. Otherwise, it is not required.
<p><b>This is the format for the ORDERED directive in C/C++:</b>
<p><p>#pragma omp for ordered [clauses...]
<p>   (loop region)
<p><p>#pragma omp ordered  newline
<p>  structured_block
<p>   (endo of loop region)
<p>
<p><h3>Run-Time Library Routines</h3>
<p>The OpenMP API includes an ever-growing number of run-time library routines. 
<p>These routines are used for a variety of purposes as shown in the table below:
 <center><img  src="20.png"/>

<p>The following are a few important Run-Time Library Routines and a more in-depth explanationâ€¦

<p><h3>omp_set_num_threads()</h3>
<p>Sets the number of threads that will be used in the next parallel region. Must be a postive integer.
<p><b>Format(C/C++): </b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>void omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads)

<p><h3>omp_get_num_threads()</h3>
<p>Returns the number of threads that are currently in the team executing the parallel region from which it is called.
<p><b>Format(C/C++): </b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>int omp_get_num_threads(void)

<p><h3>omp_get_max_threads()</h3>
<p>Returns the maximum value that can be returned by a call to the OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS function.
<p><b>Format(C/C++):</b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>int omp_get_max_threads(void)


<p><h3>omp_get_thread_num()</h3>
<p>Returns the thread number of the thread, within the team, making this call. This number will be between 0 and OMP_GET_NUM_THREADS-1. The master thread of the team is thread 0
<p><b>Format(C/C++):</b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>int omp_get_thread_num(void)


<p><h3>omp_get_num_procs()</h3>
<p>Returns the number of processors that are available to the program.
<p><b>Format(C/C++):</b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>int omp_get_num_procs(void)


<p><h3>omp_in_parallel()</h3>
<p>May be called to determine if the section of code which is executing is parallel or not.
<p><b>Format(C/C++):</b>
<p>#include <omp.h>
<p>int omp_in_parallel(void)
